<h2>Managed Services<a class="headerlink" href="#managed-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Network Operators are facing unprecedented competition from device manufacturers, innovative internet service providers and rich content and media providers as data ARPU accelerates to exceed voice.&nbsp; This trend, and the pressure to innovate and add value while continuing to drive down both capital and operational expenditure, means there is a growing demand for strategic suppliers, such as Acuity Group, to offer increasing levels of support and maintenance right up to fully managed services.
Through Acuity Group’s established Managed Services model, Acuity Group is able to offer additional expertise and benefits in economies of scale achieved through managing the Acuity Group platform for Acuity Group customers globally.&nbsp; The Managed Services support model provides operators with significant operational savings through risk mitigation and overhead cost reductions.&nbsp; The Managed Services arrangement builds upon best-in-class software solutions and establishes a single overall operations contract under which Acuity Group will provide, operate, support, and maintain the solution; reporting on the solution&#8217;s performance and reliability against an agreed set of service levels.
Operator pressure on capital and operational expenditure due to profitability and efficiency needs arising from faster changing markets and their competitive threats
Capital expenditure – normally cited as better allocation of capital than savings; with a focus on more strategic needs
Efficiency – focus on core competences and leverage partnership strategies
Pressure on technology change, business model change, increasing complexity, consolidation – drives simplification of internal business process, headcount and operations
Leaves the operator to focus on brand, their value-add, and customer service management
